# Vessel Mapper

I built this page for mapping vessels whilst delivering a JavaScript course for the MetOffice back in 2018. It uses Leaflet for the map stuff and obtains data from marinetraffic.com APIs. I wanted to show the delegates that they need not use complex frameworks like Angular or React to build small-scale apps like this. Note that tokens.js, the script in which the API tokens are declared, is not included for obvious reasons.
